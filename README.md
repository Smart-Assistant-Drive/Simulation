This repository contains the code for the gui simulation project. 
The simulation is designed to model read from the components of the SAD system and visualize their interactions.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of SAD system components
- Gui that displays the roadmap, the traffic lights, signs and the cars moving on the road

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- Gradle 8.7 or higher
- The SAD System up and running
- The Scene confiscated properly (use scene.js)

## Running the Simulation
